# Welcome to Jenkins.io Web Components

Source Code: https://github.com/halkeye/jenkins-io-components/

This is an attempt to build web components that can be used across various jenkins.io based projects

Some examples:

* https://www.jenkins.io
* https://stories.jenkins.io
* https://plugins.jenkins.io

## Installation

@jenkinsci/jenkins-io-components is distributed on npm, so you can install it locally or use it via npm CDNs like unpkg.com.

### Local Installation

```bash
npm i @jenkinsci/jenkins-io-components
```

### CDN

npm CDNs like [unpkg.com]() can directly serve files that have been published to npm. This works great for standard JavaScript modules that the browser can load natively.

For this element to work from unpkg.com specifically, you need to include the `?module` query parameter, which tells unpkg.com to rewrite "bare" module specifiers to full URLs.

#### Modern Browsers 

```html
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@jenkinsci/jenkins-io-components?module"></script>
```

#### Mix of modern and legacy

```html

<!-- to polyfill things needed by older browsers -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs@2.6.0/webcomponents-loader.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/lit@2.4.0/polyfill-support.js"></script>
<!-- load the components (module for modern, cjs for legacy) -->
<script data="jio" src="https://unpkg.com/@jenkinsci/jenkins-io-components?module" type="module"></script>
<script data="jio" nomodule="" src="https://unpkg.com/@jenkinsci/jenkins-io-components"></script>
````

## Usage

Once loaded (above), add as regular html tags

```html
<jio-navbar></jio-navbar>
```
